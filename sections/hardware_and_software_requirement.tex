\section{HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS}
\subsection{Hardware Requirements}
We used the system with following specifications for training:
\begin{itemize}
    \item PC with Windows 11
    \item 16 GB RAM 
    \item Nvidia Geforce GTX 1050(4GB)
    \item 256 GB storage
    \item Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-8300H CPU @ 2.30GHz
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Software Requirements}
The software requirements for developing, training, evaluating, and deploying the
model effectively are listed below: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item {\bf Integrated Development Environment (IDE):} We used Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as IDE for training, testing and documentation. 
    It  is open-source source code editor with a rich set of features that make it popular among developers. It is available on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
    \item {\bf Version Control System:} We used Git and Github. Git is a distributed version control system. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on projects, keeping track of modifications, managing different versions of files, and merging changes.
    \item {\bf Web framework:} We simply used Streamlit framework. Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it remarkably easy to create and share beautiful, custom web apps for machine learning and data science.
    \item {\bf Deep-Learning Frameworks:} We used PyTorch. It is an open-source, Python-based deep learning library. It allows to build and train neural networks for various tasks like computer vision, natural language processing, and more.
\end{enumerate}
