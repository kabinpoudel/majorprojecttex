\section{FEASIBLITY ANALYSIS}
We are planning to use deep learning to develop a system that can increase the
resolution of image. The system is trained on dataset of high-resolution images and
low-resolution images generated using degradation model to generate high resolution
images from low resolution images.\\
Deep learning is shown to be very effective for ISR. There are many models
developed for this task we can take inspiration from. The technical feasibility of this
project is therefore high. The cost of developing the system will depend on the size of
the dataset used to train the model, and the complexity of the model. As we are planning
to train the model on server and deploy the system on cloud-based service. So, server
costs will be our main cost for this project. \\
The technical and economic feasibility analysis show that we can complete this
project successfully.
