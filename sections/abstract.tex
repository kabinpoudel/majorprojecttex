Image Super Resolution (ISR) techniques have been developed for a long time. It has witnessed substantial advancements in recent years, aiming to enhance the visual quality of low-resolution images. This study compares different ISR technique based on deep learning and suggest which works best on different scenarios.\\
This study conducts a comparative analysis of SRGAN which includes both SRResNet and SRGAN, aiming to assess its performance and characteristics in the context of image super-resolution. The investigation includes an exploration of the SRGAN architecture, training process, and quantitative/qualitative evaluation methodologies. Visual comparisons are made with ResNet and GAN techniques.The study aims to provide valuable insights for enthusiasts and researcher interested in using SRGAN for high-quality image super-resolution.\\
