Image Super Resolution (ISR) techniques have been developed for a long time. It have witnessed substantial advancements in recent years, aiming to enhance the visual quality of low-resolution images. This paper compares different ISR technique based on deep learning and suggest which works best on different scenarios.\\
This paper includes comparison of ISR methods including SRGAN, SRCNN, SRResNet and ESRGAN. Each technique has distinct architectural approaches and training methodologies, addressing the common goal of reconstructing high-resolution images from their low-resolution counterparts.
