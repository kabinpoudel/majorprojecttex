The instructors are responsible to ensure the smoothness of the classroom activities alongside with the monitoring the student's attendance, attention and activities. Manual observation is a tedious job and affects the whole learning process. With the incorporation of IOT devices and computational algorithms 

The collected preliminary data-set from area around Kathmandu valley and the country's major lines are able to map some interesting features and environmental proxies that are visualised and the patterns and variations in it are explored using various models namely such as Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), Recurrent neural network (RNN), which worked best for time series database.
